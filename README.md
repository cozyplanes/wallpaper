<a name="disclaimer_copyright">1</a>: Okay, so there may be a confusion with the copyright. The original image was made by `Tim Rogus` working as a designer in `devrant.io`. I got that image, editted it a bit, and recreated as a `1920 * 1080` wallpaper. All kudos go to `Tim Rogus`, but just praise me a little bit (just a teeny, weeny, bit). Hope that clarifies it.
